# Specifications

Duvet currently supports two specification formats: IETF and Markdown. Specifications using either of these formats will be scanned for requirements using the [RFC 2119](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2119) key words (e.g. `MUST`, `SHOULD`, `MAY`, etc.) and track completion of these requirements. If a specification does not use these key words, or has additional requirements, then [requirement files](./annotations.md#spec) can be provided in the [configuration](./config.md).
