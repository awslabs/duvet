## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose

The Duvet MCP server MUST facilitate requirements traceability by exposing project specifications, requirements, and citations through a standardized API. It MUST enable AI models to query, validate, and analyze traceability data, ensuring requirements are properly linked to code implementations.

This document specifies:
- Resource access requirements
- Tool functionality requirements
- Data model requirements
- Interface requirements
- Error handling requirements
- Security requirements

### 1.3 Document Organization

This document is organized hierarchically, with each section building upon previous sections:
- Sections 1-2 provide context and terminology
- Section 3 defines core server requirements
- Section 4 specifies resource interface requirements
- Section 5 details tool functionality requirements
- Sections 6-7 cover operational aspects including system prompts and error handling

## 2. Terminology

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.

Additional terminology:
- Citation: A reference in code that links to a specific requirement
