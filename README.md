## Duvet

A code quality tool to help bound correctness.
By starting from a specification Duvet extracts every RFC 2119 requirement.
Duvet can then use this information to report on a code base.
Duvet can then report on every requirement,
where it is honored in source,
as well as how that source is tested.
