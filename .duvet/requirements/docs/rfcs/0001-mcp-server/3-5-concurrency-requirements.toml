# 3.5 Concurrency Requirements
#
# The server:
# - MUST implement thread-safe resource access:
#   - MUST use appropriate synchronization primitives
#   - MUST prevent data races
#   - MUST handle deadlock prevention
#   - SHOULD support read/write locks for improved performance
# - MUST handle concurrent requests:
#   - MUST support multiple simultaneous clients
#   - MUST maintain request isolation
#   - MUST implement request queuing
#   - SHOULD support request prioritization
# - MUST implement resource locking:
#   - For citation updates
#   - For specification modifications
#   - With timeout mechanisms
#   - With deadlock detection
