# 3.4 Data Management Requirements
#
# The server:
# - MUST implement a caching strategy that:
#   - Caches frequently accessed specifications
#   - Caches validation results
#   - Implements LRU eviction
#   - Supports manual cache invalidation
# - MUST handle data persistence:
#   - MUST support in-memory storage for active sessions
#   - MUST persist citation data to disk
#   - MUST maintain data integrity during crashes
#   - SHOULD support configurable storage backends
# - MUST implement cache invalidation:
#   - When specifications are updated
#   - When citations are modified
#   - After configurable time periods
#   - On explicit invalidation requests
